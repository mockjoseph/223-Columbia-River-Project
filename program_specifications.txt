Feature: `create_tree(RiverTree & tree)`

Purpose:
  Build and populate a `RiverTree` representing the Columbia River system by inserting nodes for its main stem, tributaries, and dams in a predefined order.

Assumptions:

   `tree.root` is initially `nullptr`.
   All `new RiverNode(...)` calls succeed and produce valid pointers.
   The overloaded `tree.add_node(RiverNode* & parent, RiverNode* newNode)` inserts each node at the correct location (e.g. left or right) based on matching the parent name string.

Inputs:

  * A reference to an empty or existing `RiverTree` object.

Outputs:

  None (void).  No return value.

State Changes:

   Allocates and links multiple `RiverNode` instances into `tree`, setting `tree.root` on the first insertion and then growing its left/right subtrees.
   After completion, `tree` holds the entire Columbia River system hierarchy.

Cases & Expected Behavior:

  1. Empty tree:
    First call `add_node(tree.root, new RiverNode("Willamette", …, "Columbia"))` sets `tree.root` to a Columbia‑River root node if implementation treats root insertion specially.

  2. Inserting a tributary:
    When adding “Clackamas” with parent “Willamette,” the implementation must locate the Willamette node in the left subtree of Columbia and attach Clackamas as a child (e.g. right child if tributaries are modeled on that side).
  
  3. Inserting a dam:
    For “Bonneville Dam” with parent “Columbia River,” it must find the Columbia node and attach the dam node appropriately.
  
  4. Final structure:

    After all calls, traversing `tree` in preorder or in-order should list Columbia’s dams and tributaries in the order specified (Willamette group, Snake group, Kootenay group, etc.).
  
  5. Error handling:

    If any parent name isn’t found, a robust implementation might print an error or ignore that insertion; but as coded, it assumes every parent exists in turn.

Feature: `explore_tree(RiverTree & tree)`

Purpose:
  Provide an interactive, console‑based navigation of the already‑built `RiverTree`, allowing the user to traverse upstream (left), downstream (parent), or into tributaries (right) from any current node.

Assumptions:

   `tree.root` is non‑null and fully initialized.
    Every node’s `left` and `right` pointers correctly reference sub‑rivers or dams.
   The `RiverNode` struct has a public `parent` pointer that can be set on the fly.
   `tree.print_node(RiverNode*)` displays the current node’s details (name, length, flow, etc.).

Inputs:

   A reference to a populated `RiverTree`.

Outputs:

   None (void); user sees console prompts and node data.

State Changes:

   Temporarily sets `current->parent` pointers as it moves, but does **not** modify the underlying tree structure permanently.
   Tracks a local `RiverNode* current` that moves around the tree.

Cases & Expected Behavior:

  1. Start at root:

    `current = tree.root`; calling `print_node(current)` shows Columbia River.
  2. **Move upstream (`choice==1`):**

    If `current->left` exists, set its `parent` to `current`, then `current = current->left`. Otherwise, print “No upstream path available!” and stay.

  3. Move to tributary (`choice==2`):

    Similarly for `current->right`.

  4. Move downstream (`choice==3`):

    Only shown if `current != root`. Moves `current` to previously set `current->parent`.

  5. Return to main menu (`choice==4`):

    Exit the loop and return control to `main()`.

  6. Invalid choice:

    Prints an error message and re‑prompts.
